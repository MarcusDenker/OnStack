Questions:

- #findContextsForMethod: returns the sender context, but that is nil for the first context of the Process
	-> we have to return maybe a touple: both sender and found context. 

- Simple replace of method works, but we have to signal the semaphore twice. Why?


- What if the MetaLink adds temps for stack manipulation?
	-> we need to create a new context...

- Blocks. What to do if we install on a node that is part of a block

	-> do we need to replace the compiledBlock of all Closures that are in the system somewhere?
	-> Update the method (or outer block). The compiledBlock is in the literals
	-> This could simplify the problem, as if we install a link in anothher closure, we do not have to change that CompiledBlock, nor the method.

Next Step
=========


-> Try to not replace the method, but create a new context and insert that intead of the
orginal.
	-> take care about temps
	-> and the operand stack... 
			can this lead to problems? e.g. link is executing when receiver is already pushed on the stack. e.g. debugger

This method does a lot of what we need to do:

```
simulateValueWithArguments: anArray caller: aContext
	"Simulate the valueWithArguments: primitive. Fail if anArray is not an array of the right arity."
	| newContext |
	newContext := (Context newForMethod: self compiledBlock)
						setSender: aContext
						receiver: self receiver
						method: self compiledBlock
						closure: self
						startpc: self compiledBlock initialPC.
	((newContext objectClass: anArray) ~~ Array
	 or: [numArgs ~= anArray size]) ifTrue:
		[^Context primitiveFailTokenFor: nil].
	newContext stackp: self compiledBlock numTemps.
	1 to: numArgs do:
		[:i| newContext at: i put: (anArray at: i)].
	1 to: self basicSize do:
		[:i| newContext at: i + numArgs put: (self at: i)].
	^newContext
	
```
-> Try to replace a method where we have to change the PC, too.
	- How to know the size of the BC that the metalink creates?


Notes:
======



Later:

- Check Restart in the Debugger? How is it implemented? It does do replace a context!
	--> this is I think preRefresh:, so not that interesting.
- Experiment in debugger: can we now use breakpoints as people think, that is, add a br later and 
   debugger will break if we continue.
- Recursive methods?
- What is the API for on-stack replacement?
- Think about refactorings in general, can we support more?
